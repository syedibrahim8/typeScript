// TypeScript Introduction

/*
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of Javascript which adds static typing
This basically means that typescript adds syntax on top of Javascript, allowing developers to add types.

In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information!

So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
