// TypeScript Definitely Typed

// Using non-typed NPM packages in TypeScript
// Using untyped NPM packages with TypeScript is not type-safe because types are missing.

// To help TypeScript developers use such packages, there is a community-maintained project called Definitely Typed.

// Definitely Typed is a project that provides a central repository of TypeScript definitions for NPM packages which do not have types.

// Example
// npm install --save-dev @types/jquery
